# Star Wars
A simple Star Wars RPG.

The user chooses from two missions: ambushing the Sith Lord and his troop, or capturing an Imperial base.

The first scenario involves a simple fight between a Rebel troop and an Imperial troop. The user succeeds 
if the Imperial troop is defeated.

The second scenario involves opening the door to an Imperial base using an astromech droid, then pitting the
user's Jedi against the enemy Sith Lord. The user succeeds if the Sith Lord loses all health before its Jedi does.

Fights involve the user being prompted to choose an action and a target for that action. All other character actions
and targets are randomized for each turn. Certain actions require a certain amount of energy. A small amount of energy is recovered each turn.

Enjoy!
